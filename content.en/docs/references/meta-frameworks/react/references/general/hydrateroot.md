#### `hydrateRoot()` <a href="#hydrateroot" id="hydrateroot"></a>

```
hydrateRoot(container, element[, options])
```

Same as [`createRoot()`](https://devdocs.io/react/react-dom-client#createroot), but is used to hydrate a container whose HTML contents were rendered by [`ReactDOMServer`](https://devdocs.io/react/react-dom-server). React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup.

`hydrateRoot` accepts two options:

* `onRecoverableError`: optional callback called when React automatically recovers from errors.
* `identifierPrefix`: optional prefix React uses for ids generated by `React.useId`. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix used on the server.

> Note
>
> React expects that the rendered content is identical between the server and the client. It can patch up differences in text content, but you should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them. In development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is important for performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be prohibitively expensive.
