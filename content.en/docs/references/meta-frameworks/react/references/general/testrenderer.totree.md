# testRenderer.toTree()

#### `testRenderer.toTree()` <a href="#testrenderertotree" id="testrenderertotree"></a>

```
testRenderer.toTree()
```

Return an object representing the rendered tree. The representation is more detailed than the one provided by `toJSON()`, and includes the user-written components. You probably don’t need this method unless you’re writing your own assertion library on top of the test renderer.
