`UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()` is invoked before a mounted component receives new props. If you need to update the state in response to prop changes (for example, to reset it), you may compare `this.props` and `nextProps` and perform state transitions using `this.setState()` in this method.

Note that if a parent component causes your component to re-render, this method will be called even if props have not changed. Make sure to compare the current and next values if you only want to handle changes.

React doesn’t call `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()` with initial props during [mounting](https://devdocs.io/react/react-component#mounting). It only calls this method if some of component’s props may update. Calling `this.setState()` generally doesn’t trigger `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()`.
