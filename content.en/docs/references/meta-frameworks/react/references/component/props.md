# ðŸŒµ props

#### `props` <a href="#props" id="props"></a>

`this.props` contains the props that were defined by the caller of this component. See [Components and Props](https://devdocs.io/react/components-and-props) for an introduction to props.

In particular, `this.props.children` is a special prop, typically defined by the child tags in the JSX expression rather than in the tag itself.
