# Elements

React elements are the building blocks of React applications. One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. An element describes what you want to see on the screen. React elements are immutable.

```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
```

Typically, elements are not used directly, but get returned from components.
