# Bundlers

Bundlers take JavaScript and CSS code written as separate modules (often hundreds of them), and combine them together into a few files better optimized for the browsers. Some bundlers commonly used in React applications include [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).
