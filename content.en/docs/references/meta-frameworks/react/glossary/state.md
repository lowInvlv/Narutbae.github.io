# 🌵 state

A component needs `state` when some data associated with it changes over time. For example, a `Checkbox` component might need `isChecked` in its state, and a `NewsFeed` component might want to keep track of `fetchedPosts` in its state.

The most important difference between `state` and `props` is that `props` are passed from a parent component, but `state` is managed by the component itself. A component cannot change its `props`, but it can change its `state`.

For each particular piece of changing data, there should be just one component that “owns” it in its state. Don’t try to synchronize states of two different components. Instead, lift it up to their closest shared ancestor, and pass it down as props to both of them.
