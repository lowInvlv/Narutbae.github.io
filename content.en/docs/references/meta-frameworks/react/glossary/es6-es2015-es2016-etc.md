# ES6, ES2015, ES2016, etc

These acronyms all refer to the most recent versions of the ECMAScript Language Specification standard, which the JavaScript language is an implementation of. The ES6 version (also known as ES2015) includes many additions to the previous versions such as: arrow functions, classes, template literals, `let` and `const` statements. You can learn more about specific versions [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Versions).
