# useLayoutEffect

#### `useLayoutEffect` <a href="#uselayouteffect" id="uselayouteffect"></a>

The signature is identical to `useEffect`, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. Use this to read layout from the DOM and synchronously re-render. Updates scheduled inside `useLayoutEffect` will be flushed synchronously, before the browser has a chance to paint.

Prefer the standard `useEffect` when possible to avoid blocking visual updates.

> Tip
>
> If you’re migrating code from a class component, note `useLayoutEffect` fires in the same phase as `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`. However, **we recommend starting with `useEffect` first** and only trying `useLayoutEffect` if that causes a problem.
>
> If you use server rendering, keep in mind that _neither_ `useLayoutEffect` nor `useEffect` can run until the JavaScript is downloaded. This is why React warns when a server-rendered component contains `useLayoutEffect`. To fix this, either move that logic to `useEffect` (if it isn’t necessary for the first render), or delay showing that component until after the client renders (if the HTML looks broken until `useLayoutEffect` runs).
>
> To exclude a component that needs layout effects from the server-rendered HTML, render it conditionally with `showChild && <Child />` and defer showing it with `useEffect(() => { setShowChild(true); }, [])`. This way, the UI doesn’t appear broken before hydration.
