      <description>Add React to a Website # If you want to add some interactivity to your existing project, you don’t have to rewrite it in React. Add React to your existing stack, and render interactive React components anywhere.
Note # You need to install Node.js for local development. Although you can try React online or with a simple HTML page, realistically most JavaScript tooling you’ll want to use for development requires Node.</description>

      <description>CDN Links # Both React and ReactDOM are available over a CDN.
&amp;lt;script crossorigin src=&amp;#34;https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script crossorigin src=&amp;#34;https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; The versions above are only meant for development, and are not suitable for production. Minified and optimized production versions of React are available at:
&amp;lt;script crossorigin src=&amp;#34;https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script crossorigin src=&amp;#34;https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; To load a specific version of react and react-dom, replace 18 with the version number.
Why the crossorigin Attribute? # If you serve React from a CDN, we recommend to keep the crossorigin attribute set:</description>

      <description>Create a New React App # If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community. Frameworks provide features that most apps and sites eventually need, including routing, data fetching, and generating HTML.
Note # You need to install Node.js for local development. You can also choose to use Node.js in production, but you don’t have to.</description>
